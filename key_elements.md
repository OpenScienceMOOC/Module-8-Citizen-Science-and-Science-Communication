### Tasks:

* Search and make a short list of your institution's people involved in outreach, PR etc. Do you know everybody important for what you do?

* Read a press release from your institution.

    * How does it compare to the research article itself?

* Write a blog post summarising a selection of your research papers to date.

    * Start a blog and post them!

    * If possible, connect this to your main website.

* Respond to discussions on (social) media about your topic of research.

    * Use hashtags to find relevant conversations.

    * Who is popular in your field? What do you notice about their style of engagement?

* Identify relevant citizen science initiatives on social media. 

    * Add them to your contacts.

    * Reach out to them and open a conversation on how you could mutually benefit from shared research.

* How would you communicate with protesters in front of your institute?

* What policy-level consultations are open at the moment at a national level?

    * Are any of them in a discipline or topic related to yours?

    * If so, draft a short response based on your understanding of the relevant research.
