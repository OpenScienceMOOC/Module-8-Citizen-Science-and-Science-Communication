# Module 8: Public Engagement with Science

## Rationale <a name="Rationale"></a>

Our world is going through some dramatic changes. Now, more than ever, the role of science in society is critical - particularly in helping to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Science communication is often seen as a unidirectional process from scientist to non-scientists. However, while researchers can be key players in this, through careful and strategic planning, the role of the wider public in the research process itself can be leveraged for much more power. For this, a deeper understanding of the basic principles, tools, and methods of public engagement with science is required, including the vast capabilities of newer channels like social media. This module of the Open Science MOOC will teach effective techniques for communicating your research with a wider audience, as well as engaging them with the process itself.

## Learning outcomes <a name="Learning outcomes"></a>

1. Researchers, open science community, and science outreach specialists  will be able to identify and describe some of the major different types of audience and stakeholders involved in science communication, what their needs and viewpoints are, and the importance of citizen science and public engagement with science.
1. By working either individually or within their research group, researchers will be able to use a range of communication channels, including social media, to strategically engage different types of audience with their research.
1. Researchers and citizens will learn how to work together, from the codesign of a research project to the process of citizen science research, helping avoid common mistakes in the planning of citizen science projects.
1. If there are relevant policy-related issues to their discipline, researchers will be able to engage with them through available channels and make sure that their research field is appropriately represented.
1. Researchers will be able to identify relevant press/communication contacts at their institute, and be able to convey to them why their research is of importance for wider dissemination.
1. Researchers and open-science community will be able to write a blog post or non-specialist summary about either their own research or research that they are familiar with, and communicate this to wider non-academic audiences.
